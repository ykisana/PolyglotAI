1. Reply to the user in ${language}, ignoring the incorrect grammar.
2. Provide a translation for your reply.`;

give me a javascript list of objects, 
they should be the each ${language} word, the definition should be the english word. 
Try to find the ${language} words, if you have trouble finding the ${language} words, still make attempt.
When you encounter punctuation or special characters, ignore them and make an attempt.
if no ${language} words,  return an empty array.
Here is an example of the format I need, but for Spanish, 
[{ "word": "Hola", "definition": "Hello" }, { "word": "cómo", "definition": "how" }] { "word": "estás", "definition": "to be" }]`;
